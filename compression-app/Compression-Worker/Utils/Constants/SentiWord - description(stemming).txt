SentiWordNet is a lexical resource in which each RoWordNet synset
is associated to three numerical scores Obj(s), Pos(s) and Neg(s),
describing how objective, positive, and negative the terms contained
in the synset are. It was created by translating SentiWordnet into
Romanian using googletrans Python library.
